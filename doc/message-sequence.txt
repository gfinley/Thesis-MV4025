Simplified sequence
-------------------
parameters <- S
role-request -> S

Repeat indefinitely:

action -> S (if blue is on move and state is non-terminal)

At any time, any player may:
reset-request -> S
S -> reset

At any time, any player may:
next-game-request -> S 
Followed by, for all players:

Old sequence
------------
role-request -> S
role-assigned <- S
ready-to-start -> S
phase setup <- S

* zero or more times
* setup move OR setup exchange -> S
* observation <- S

end-setup -> S
phase wait <- S
waiting -> S

*zero or more times
* observation <- S
* waiting -> S

phase move <- S

*zero or more times
* action move OR action fire*** -> S
* action fire -> S
* observation <- S

end-move -> S
phase wait <- S

*zero or more times
* observation <- S
* waiting -> S

Go to phase move message above
